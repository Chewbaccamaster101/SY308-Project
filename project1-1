First the user must start a session each of Router.py, Bank.py, and atm.py.
The user will then copy the contents of a "user.card" into a file "inserted.card".
The User will go into the atm.py session and enter the command "begin-session".
begin-session will read the contents on the card and prompt for the user
to confirm his/her identity with a four digit pin. The pins are as follows:
Alice:0000
Bob:1111
Carol:2222

The ATM will then grant access to the User's bank account. The User may now enter one of
three commands. The withdraw command is the only command with a supporting argument.
The "amt" will be the monetary amount(in digits) that the user wishes to withdraw.
balance
withdraw amt
end-session

typing "end-session" into the atm prompt will and the user's session, therefore
causing them to "begin-session" again before any more actions may be taken.

Our ATM machine adheres to the fail-safe default principle because no withdraws
will be attainable if there is no connection with the bank machine. The bank machine
holds the balance information.

Our ATM machine also carries a least privilege mechanism. The user at the atm
will not be able to even access the commands the atm has to offer unless they are signed
into their account. The whole system changes accounts along with the user, so they may not effect others
accounts.
